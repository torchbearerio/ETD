% Dedication

This thesis has truly been one of the greatest challenges, if not the greatest challenge, I have faced so far. But to say it was a result solely of my own labor would be immensely far from the truth. The end result is due to the support, understanding and love of so many people in my life, without whom I would never be writing this today.

To my wife, Annie, who has stood by my side through thick and thin, who has allowed me to devote so much of the time that belongs to us to this work. To her I promise to make up the time, and then some.

To my parents, Jan and Dick, whose relentless help with whatever passion I might be pursuing has led to opportunities I am incredibly fortunate to have had. While I didn't always realize it, their passion for science, ingenuity and worldly understanding was always driving me towards this point. They are truly the only role models, the only inspiration I will ever need.

To all of my family: Chris and Lori, Nana and Opa; Gwen, Jim, Carey and Mark; Jo and Michael, Dorian, Gina and Carl. Thank you for being a part of my life.
