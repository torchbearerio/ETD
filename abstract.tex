% Abstract 
The task of navigation adds a cognitive distraction to the already dangerous task of driving. Most popular navigation aids provide spoken directions based solely on distances and street names, but the inclusion of landmark descriptions in these instructions has been shown to improve navigation performance and reduce cognitive load. In order to provide such instructions, an automated method of selecting landmarks and building landmark-based instructions is required. Current approaches are based on a single source of data, or use a single factor in choosing the best landmark. We develop a multi-pipeline system that leverages both human (crowd-sourced) input and machine-based approaches to find and describe and choose the best landmark, and build a mobile application for the delivery of navigation instructions based on this landmark. We evaluate the cost and performance differences between these pipelines, as well as study the effect of each on cognitive load, safe driving behavior and navigation performance via an in situ experiment.
