First, a huge debt of gratitude is owed to my advisor and committee chair, Dr. Mike Wittie. Without his guidance on technical issue and writing, this project could not have been completed. I must also thank Dr. Laura Stanley, who's expertise in human factors and driving research shaped the goals and evaluation methodologies of this work.

The Torchbearer Mobile App, without which this project could never have been put into the hands of drivers, was given a great deal of time and code by Brendan Smith.

The dataset of Google Streetview images was meticulously annotated to include bounding boxes and labels by Cole Homan.
